# Ignore files in the uploads directory, but keep the directory itself if you want
# To ignore all files within 'uploads' but not 'uploads' itself:
uploads/*
!uploads/.gitkeep 
# (Then `touch uploads/.gitkeep` to ensure the empty dir can be tracked if desired, 
# or just let git ignore 'uploads' completely if you don't need the empty dir in repo)
